-- shmup core: the spawn timeline. A level is an ordered list of entries:
--
--   { t = 5.5,   type = "darter", x = 60, n = 5, dx = 70 }  -- n copies, spaced
--   { t = 40,    boss = "dreadnought" }                     -- arm the boss
--   { at = 1900, boss = "core" }                            -- ...at a PLACE
--
-- `t` is seconds since the level started. `at` is a player x. Both exist
-- because the frame decides which one means anything: in a scroller the world
-- comes to you at a fixed rate, so a time IS a distance and the clock is the
-- only sensible index. In the free frame the world does not move at all -- you
-- can hover, or fly backwards -- so a clock indexes nothing, and the only
-- honest trigger is where the player actually is.
--
-- n copies are spaced by (dx, dy). Vertical games default y to just above the
-- top edge; horizontal games pass an x at the right edge. There is no scripting
-- language here on purpose: a wave is data, and a level you can read in one
-- screenful is a level you can tune.
