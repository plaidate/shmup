-- shmup core: a scrolling cavern for "side" games (Scramble-style). Ground and
-- ceiling are white silhouettes; the ship flies the black gap between them.
--
-- THE ONE RULE: there is a single sampled profile, and the renderer and the
-- collider both read it. The old code drew a polygon sampled every 16px (a
-- chain of chords) and collided against the exact continuous sine that
-- generated it -- two different curves. Between samples the true curve bows
-- away from the chord, so the wall you SEE was not the wall you HIT: near a
-- crest the ship died in visibly empty black, in a trough it flew through
-- white. The error was under a pixel, which is exactly why it was poison --
-- invisible in a screenshot, absent from every counter, and felt by the player
-- as an unfair death they cannot explain and you cannot reproduce.
--
-- Now: sample() fills two arrays, draw() fills the polygons from them, and
-- hits() linearly interpolates WITHIN them. Coarsen STEP and both halves
-- coarsen together. They cannot disagree -- there is no second source of truth
-- for them to disagree about.
